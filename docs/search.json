      "contents": "\nWhat: This is a workshop on Bayesian inference of\nanimal demography. Hopefully, you will learn about how to infer\ndemographic parameters (e.g. survival, dispersal). Our hope is to\nprovide you with what you need to go your own path. The event is free of\ncharge, and video-recorded.\nFor whom: This is a workshop for ecologists. No\nprevious experience with Nimble or Bayesian statistics is\nassumed, but knowledge of R is required.\nHow: Through a combination of lectures and live\ndemonstrations, you will get acquainted with the Bayesian approach, MCMC\nmethods and the R Nimble package to fit\nsingle-site, multi-site, multi-state and multi-event models to\ncapture-recapture data within the hidden Markov modeling (HMM)\nframework.\nWho: O.\nGimenez, C. R. Nater,\nS. Cubaynes, P. de Valpine, M. Quéroué\nWhen: May 17-18, 2021\nWhere: Online via Zoom/Slack\nProgram\nAll times are Paris time UTC+2\nDay 1, May 17\nWelcoming words (9am-9:30am)\nCrash course on Bayesian statistics and MCMC algorithms\n(9:30am-11am)\nFree the modeler in you: Introduction to Nimble\n(11:30am-12:30pm)\nWhat you see is not what you get: Hidden Markov models and\ncapture-recapture data (2pm-3:30pm)\nDead or alive: Survival estimation - part 1 (4pm-5pm)\nDay 2, May 18\nDead or alive: Survival estimation - part 2 (9am-10:30am)\nOn the move: Transition estimation (11am-12:30pm)\nKnown knowns, unknown knowns and unknowns: Uncertainty in state\nassignment (2pm-3:30pm)\nSkip your coffee break: Speed up MCMC convergence (4pm-5pm)\nTake-home messages (5pm-5:30pm)\nRequirements\nInstall R\nand RStudio.\nInstall Nimble following these guidelines. Then run the\nfollowing code in R. If that runs without error, you’re all\nset. If not, please get in touch with us.\n\n\nlibrary(nimble)\n  code <- nimbleCode({\n  y ~ dnorm(0,1)\n  })\n  model <- nimbleModel(code)\n  cModel <- compileNimble(model)\n  \n\n\nInstall the following R packages:\ntidyverse, MCMCvis, here and\nnimbleEcology. You can install them all at once by running\nthe following code in R:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"MCMCvis\", \"here\", \"nimbleEcology\"))\n  \n\n\nTo-do list\nAdd examples of sensitivity analyses.\nMake class number match name of live demos html and R scripts\nfiles.\nAdd messages in the video recordings about typos in the slides.\nIn Nimble code for multievent models, change observation matrix at\nfirst encounter omega.init into omega.firste to avoid confusion with\nvector of initial state probabilities.\nAdd a FAQ section to the website synthesizing questions/answers in\nthe Slack.\nMore suggestions from attendees in feedback forms.\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
