      "contents": "\nWhat: This is a workshop on Bayesian inference about animal demography. Hopefully, you will learn about how to infer demographic parameters (e.g. survival, dispersal). Our hope is to provide you with what you need to go your own path. The event is free of charge, and video-recorded.\nHow: You will become comfortable with the Bayesian approach, MCMC methods and the R Nimble package to fit single-site, multi-site, multi-state and multi-event models to capture-recapture data.\nFor whom: This is a workshop for ecologists. No previous experience with Nimble or Bayesian statistics is assumed, but knowledge of R is required.\nWho: O. Gimenez, C. R. Nater, S. Cubaynes, P. de Valpine, M. Quéroué\nWhen: May 17-18, 2021\nWhere: Online\nProgram\nWelcoming words\nCrash course on Bayesian statistics and MCMC algorithms\nFree the modeler in you: Introduction to Nimble\nWhat you see is not what you get: Hidden Markov models and capture-recapture data\nDead or alive: Survival estimation\nOn the move: Transition estimation\nKnown knowns, unknown knowns and unknowns: Uncertainty in state assignment\nSkip your coffee break: Speed up MCMC convergence\nTake-home messages\nTo-do list\nHow to organise everything: Lecture and live demonstration. Q&A every 30 minutes, every hour, through Zoom and Q&A or via Slack. I’d rather have everything on Zoom to be able to record everything. Then we can format the questions in some FAQ page that could be added to the website.\nSend email to everybody giving program, what we do not cover, stuff to install\nR scripts of the lecture, more Nimble examples (not covered in the classes or live demos), Jags translation\nAdd a slide further reading at end of each section (papier de Daniel, papier Gelman sur workflow).\nNext edition: SCR models (which can be seen as HMMs), robust design, sojour time, semi-Markov, pop size is treated elsewhere.\nSome case studies\nGEESE: multisite standard comme dans Hesteck et al. 1993. Faire aussi modele à mémoire. Illustrer le lien logis généralisé. Et la Dirichlet aussi.\nDIPPER: refaire les modèles de Lebreton et al., avec et sans la covariable. Tests avec wAIC ou DIC, ou variable selection.\nSWIFTS: additives effects. Dans Lebreton et al. 1992. Model selection. Citer les papiers de Conn, Hooten.\nFLAMINGOS: Recrutement. Pradel et al. 1997.\nHOUSE FINCHES: Faustino et al. 2004 et Conn & Cooch 2009.\nGRAY WOLVES: Cubaynes et al. 2010. Hétérogénéité. Avec ou sans transition entre états.\nSOOTY SHEARWATERS. ROE DEER plutôt?\nMemory model. Trap-dependence. Comment on met les covariables avec multinomial logia link ou Dirichlet.\n\nRequirements\nInstall R and RStudio\nInstall Nimble following these guidelines.\nInstall the following R packages: tidyverse, here. You can install them all at once by running the following code in the R command line:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"here\"))\n\n\n\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
