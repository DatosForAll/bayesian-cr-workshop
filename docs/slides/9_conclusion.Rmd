# Make the best of your capture-recapture data

+ Here is [a searchable list](applistHMM.html) of HMM applications to the analysis of capture-recapture data.

+ This list is far from being exhaustive, please get in touch wih us if you'd like to add a reference.

## Bags of tricks for HMM analyses, and Nimble.


---
## Bayesian capture-recapture analysis with HMMs

+ [TO BE COMPLETED BY ALL]

+ Make your ecological question explicit. 

+ Think of observations and states first. 

+ Then write down the observation and transition matrices on paper. 

+ Start simple, all parameters constant for example.

+ Use simulations to better understand your model. 

+ Do not try to optimize your code. Make it work first. Then think of optimization.

+ Read [Bayesian workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808) by Gelman et al. (2021).

---
## Nimble

+ [TO BE COMPLETED BY ALL]

+ Go for `nimbleMCMC()` if standard needs. 

+ Unleash full `Nimble` potential for improving MCMC or implementing new distributions. 

---
## Till next time

+ Website will be updated with

    + video recordings
    + your feedbacks
    + a FAQ section based on your questions

---
## Further reading

+ A book is on its way. Release date: Some time in 2022.
