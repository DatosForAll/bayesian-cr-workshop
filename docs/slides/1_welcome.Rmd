+ Welcome to the workshop blabla
+ My name is Olivier Gimenez, I am blabla
+ Wish it was in Montpellier
+ But hey, some advantages, not sure we could have fit 500 people in our meeting room at the lab
+ Before I start, I'd like to show you a few pictures of what you‚Äôre missing. This is a bit cruel, I know. 
+ Meeting altogether in Montpellier would have been like a family reunion.

+ Running workshop for 15 years
+ Daniel Turek in sabbatical who taught us Nimble and convinced us to switch from Jags to Nimble
+ Science should be open
+ A tweet that blew up in my face

## What this workshop is about

+ Estimating demographic parameters 
+ Using a class of models called hidden Markov models
+ Within the Bayesian framework

## On our plate

### Day 1
+ Crash course on Bayesian statistics and MCMC algorithms
+ Free the modeler in you: Introduction to Nimble
+ What you see is not what you get: Hidden Markov models and capture-recapture
+ Dead or alive: Survival estimation
### Day 2
+ On the move: Transition estimation
+ Known knowns, unknown knowns and unknowns: Uncertainty in state assignment
+ Skip your coffee break: Speed up MCMC convergence 
+ Take-home messages

## Philosophy of teaching

+ We've packed lots of things to understand in two days
+ We do not expect you to digest everything in 2 days
+ All material on website <https://oliviergimenez.github.io/bayesian-cr-workshop/>
+ Feel free to play around with material while we walk through it, and afterwards

---
## The way we will interact with each other

+ The workshop is organized in modules, each of which will be a combination of lecture/live demo
+ Everything happens on Zoom
+ Questions and answers via Zoom (or Slack?)
