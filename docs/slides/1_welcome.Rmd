+ Welcome to the workshop blabla
+ My name is Olivier Gimenez, I am blabla
+ Wish it was in Montpellier
+ But hey, some advantages, not sure we could have fit 500 people in our meeting room at the lab
+ Before I start, I'd like to show you a few pictures of what you‚Äôre missing. This is a bit cruel, I know. 
+ Meeting altogether in Montpellier would have been like a family reunion.

+ Running workshop for 15 years
+ Daniel Turek in sabbatical who taught us Nimble and convinced us to switch from Jags to Nimble
+ Science should be open
+ A tweet that blew up in my face

## What this workshop is about

--

+ Estimating demographic parameters .

--

+ Using a class of models called hidden Markov models.

--

+ Within the Bayesian framework.

---
## Credits

--

+ Past workshops on capture-recapture models w/ Roger Pradel, R√©mi Choquet and Jean-Dominique Lebreton.

--

+ Past workshops on Bayesian analyses for population ecology with Ruth King, Steve Brooks and Byron Morgan.

--

+ Workshops on Nimble by Chris Paciorek, Daniel Turek and Perry de Valpine.

--

+ Workshops on integrated population modeling with Michael Schaub and Marc K√©ry.

--

+ Books by Marc K√©ry, Michael Schaub, Andy Royle and others <span>&#8212;</span> check out [curated list](https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/roylebook/)

## On our plate

--

### Day 1
+ Crash course on Bayesian statistics and MCMC algorithms
+ Free the modeler in you: Introduction to Nimble
+ What you see is not what you get: Hidden Markov models and capture-recapture
+ Dead or alive: Survival estimation

--

### Day 2
+ On the move: Transition estimation
+ Known knowns, unknown knowns and unknowns: Uncertainty in state assignment
+ Skip your coffee break: Speed up MCMC convergence 
+ Take-home messages

---
## Philosophy of teaching

--

+ Lots of attendees, with huge heterogeneity in knowledge of capture-recapture models, Bayesian methods, `R` and `Nimble`.

--

+ It is our hope that everyone will find something to take home. 


--

+ We've packed a lot of things in two days.

--

+ We do not expect you to digest everything.

--

+ All material on website <https://oliviergimenez.github.io/bayesian-cr-workshop/>.

???

Let's take a minute to have a look to the website.


--

+ Feel free to play around with material while we walk through it, and afterwards.

--

+ The workshop is organized in modules.

--

+ Each module is a combination of lectures and live demos.

---

## The way we will interact with each other

--

+ Lectures and live coding demos will happen on Zoom, same link for both days.

--

+ Everything is video recorded.

--

+ Questions and answers via Slack; a specific chanel per module.
