I know it shouldn't be that difficult to convert, I just haven't seen any examples to help get me started! Even better if they involve incorporating them into an IPM... Thanks.",

If it's a Brownie model, I have worked on an IPM that includes a standard implementation (= latent state) and can share that code. If it's a multistate model... well, everything we covered on mutlistate models applies in that case, and the dDHMM() distribution (marginalized likelihood) from the nimbleEcology package will be your friend.\n(unless you have individual- and time-varying covariates.
