I am working with Matt Betts and Damon Lesmeister to develop classification tools for use with a large scale terrestrial bioacoustic dataset.  I will then use datasets derived from classification models to explore both single species (marbled murrelet) and community (dawn chorus bird community) ecology. I have some experience with mark-recapture models using a variety of tools (Mark, RMark, JAGS), but (at least to me) these models are complex with many opportunities for missteps and I am looking forward to learning more!",
