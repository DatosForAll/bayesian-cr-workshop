My thesis focused on studying the behaviour of floater individuals in a free ranging population of spotless starlings that are marked with PIT-tags. I am currently collaborating with Dr. Ana Payo-Payo who is helping me to develop multievent models to study differences in survival between floater and territorial individuals. However, I am just starting and my background in capture recapture is small but I am enthusiastic to learn more! Looking forward to see you all soon!",
