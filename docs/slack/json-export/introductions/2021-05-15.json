My name is Marta and I have just started a post-doc at the laboratory Littoral ENvironnement et Societés (University of la Rochelle) where I will analyze how different toxics affect the survival and reproduction of an Arctic species. During my thesis I modelled CMR data using E-Surge to answer ecological and evolutive questions. With this workshop I would like to go a step further for future studies. Thank you to the organizers!",
