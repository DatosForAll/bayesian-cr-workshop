My research focuses on how individual, social and environmental factors interact to determine grey wolf population dynamics. I am particularly interested in how populations respond to global change and different management scenarios. I have never used capture-recapture models but I would like to learn about it to properly understand related literature, and because you never know what skills you will need in the future! Looking forward to see you all!",
