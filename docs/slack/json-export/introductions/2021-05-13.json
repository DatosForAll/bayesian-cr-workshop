My research is focused on migratory birds, particularly waterfowl and movement ecology using GPS\/ACC\/GSM tracking devices. I have built basic multi-state models using JAGS to understand transition probabilities among states, but am excited to dive deeper into parameterization and estimation using Nimble and to further my understanding of mark-recapture analyses. Very much looking forward to the workshop!",
