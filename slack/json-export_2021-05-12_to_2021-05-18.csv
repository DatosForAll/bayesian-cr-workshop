I have 7 years data of jaguars from an specific protected area; but the first years, we sampled in waterwholes (because the projects aims), and the last years, we sampled both waterwholes and roads/trails. From the 7 years of data, I have very nice sex and identity data from all jaguar individuals. Of course the sampling design and effort is different every year (dry season), but always from the same area (number of waterwholes, number of trail-stations, etc., but always during dry seasons every year).

Often, we don't need to estimate the latent states, we're just after the parameters. In such a case, we may get rid of the states by summing over them - this is called marginalization. Marginalization often helps to reach convergence faster (see Yackulic paper in further reading). We'll see in class 8 that Nimble provides the marginalized likelihood through nimbleEcology. Which means that in the Nimble framework we can use both the full likelihood and the marginalized likelihood, according to our needs. Isn't that awesome!

In my study system, we visit/observe colour ringed individuals in our area ""by chance"", meaning that if we are in the area, we visit the points and record whether we saw the birds expected to be there or not. The result is that the number of visits per point/bird is different. Following an advice of someone more experiences, I created one data set with 1 and 0 for ""point visited"" and one for ""bird observed"" for each day of my field season. Is it possible to overlap these two data tables, or is there another easier better way to deal with this kind of resighting data?

"914",NA,"1621257022.064100","U0203USKJRE","message","Here are some comments in relation to Stan
• Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Stan's method) is not universally always most efficient.  It mixes well at high computational cost.  Sometimes we see methods that mix less well but iterate much faster because of lower computational cost, ending up to be more efficient.  It is problem-specific.
• Yes, handling discrete latent states is not possible Stan, as I understand it.  One needs to write out the marginal probabilities.
• nimble is not just an MCMC engine.  It is a hierarchical modeling programming system.  We've seen and/or built methods like Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (max. likelihood integrating over latent states), particle filtering, and Particle MCMC (particle filter + MCMC).
• Within MCMC, nimble enables methods like reversible jump (for variable selection) and Bayesian non-parametric distributions, both of which rely on discrete latent states.
• We are building support for automatic differentiation and hence HMC, Laplace approximation, and other methods that need derivatives to be efficient.
• That's a quick early-morning (in California) reply!
