I am a PhD student in Brice Semmens' lab at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego.  One of my dissertation chapters employs a multistate mark-recapture model using historical tagging data of Barred Sand Bass that spans different oceanographic periods and fishing intensities.  I have built up on the model in chapter 9.5 of Kery and Schaub's BPA text to incorporate tag loss and angler resightings using 5 states and 4 observation types.  I am most interested in how to convert this over to Nimble and learn any new tricks!",
