## Till next time

+ Website will be updated 
+ Video recordings
+ Your questions will become a FAQ
+ HMMs are everywhere: SCR models (which can be seen as HMMs), robust design, sojour time, semi-Markov, pop size Jolly-Seber, IPMs (Besbeas and Morgan)...
+ Bags of tricks for HMM, and Nimble

## Bag of tricks and recommendations

+ Think of OBS and STATES first. And the observation and transition matrices.
+ Start simple, all parameters constant for example. 
+ Use simulations!!
+ Do not try to optimize your code. Make it work first. Then think of optimization.
+ Workflow by Gelman et al. 
+ Sensitivity analyses.
